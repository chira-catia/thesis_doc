LKL-Net is a network simulator that simulates network devices using the TCP/IP stack implemented in the Linux Kernel. Currently LKL-Net simulates host, router, switch, NAT and firewall devices. One of its most important advantages is that it can benefit from the improvements in the Linux Kernel with little effort.
