\chapter{Further Work}
\label{chapter:further}
In order for this project to be easier to use and to serve its purpose better the following must be considered for further development.
\subsubsection{Scenario replay}
\label{sec:scenario-replay}
Having the hub as a device connector makes this task not too hard to implement. Such a feature can be useful both for educational purposes as well as for research ones.
\subsubsection{Migration to other OS}
\label{sec:migration-os}

\subsubsection{Physical layer simulation}
\label{sec:physica-sim}

\subsubsection{Configuration of a routing protocol}
\label{sec:routing-prot}
Being able to configurate a routing protocol would make simulating complex topologies easier and, at the same time, testing different scenarios would require less time to configure. 

\subsubsection{Communication between multiple hypervisors}
\label{sec:hypervisor-comm}
At present the hypervisor is responsible for starting all the devices, commanding them to write changes to their configuration files and listening for requests for name-solving. In the future we are considering to add the facility to comunicate between different hypervisors that might or might not be located on different physical systems.
