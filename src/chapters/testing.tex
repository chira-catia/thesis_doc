\section{Round Trip Time and Throughput}
\label{sec:rt-troughput}

In order to test the Response Time for a LKL device we have chosen the router and built a simple topology shown in \figref{img:throughput}:
\fig[scale=0.5]{src/img/throughput.png}{img:throughput}{Topology for testing Response Time and Throughput}
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[htb]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
      Device Name & Interface & IP & Port \\ \hline
      Router0 & eth0 & 191.168.100.1/24 & x \\ \hline
      Hub0 & x & x & 50001\\ 
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Throughput topology description}
  \label{table:resp-time}
  \end{table}
\end{center}


For injecting traffic in the topology a bridge was connected to the hub and a route to the router's network 
was added via tap0. In order for the bridge to connect to the hub, a configuration file is passed as a command 
line argument when running it for specifying the port and the system's address where the hub runs.
The  configuration file is: 
\lstset{language=TeX, caption=Bridge configuration file}
\lstinputlisting{src/code/bridge/bridge-config}
For starting the bridge, root rights are needed in order to create the tap interface.
The commands for setting the tap interface, after starting the bridge are:
\lstset{language=TeX,caption=Commands for configuring the tap interface,label=test-bridge-config}
\begin{lstlisting}
Setting the tap interface up: sudo ip link set tap0 up
Setting an IPv4 address on the new created tap interface: sudo ip addr add 192.168.100.100/24 dev tap0
Adding a new route to the router interface through tap0 interface: sudo ip route add 192.168.100.0/24 dev tap0
\end{lstlisting}

The next step is to inject traffic into the topology via the bridge(tap0) using ping.
For two transmissions of 1000 packets using ping (in)the results are:
\lstset{language=Tex, caption=}
\begin{lstlisting}
$sudo ping -f 192.168.100.1 -c 1000 -s 1400
PING 192.168.100.1 (192.168.100.1) 1400(1428) bytes of data.
                
--- 192.168.100.1 ping statistics ---
1000 packets transmitted, 1000 received, 0% packet loss, time 13771ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 35.973/114.888/200.100/34.401 ms, pipe 16, ipg/ewma 13.785/128.326 ms

$ sudo ping -f 192.168.100.1 -c 1000 
PING 192.168.100.1 (192.168.100.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
               
--- 192.168.100.1 ping statistics ---
1000 packets transmitted, 1000 received, 0% packet loss, time 13538ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 6.929/112.462/196.023/34.576 ms, pipe 15, ipg/ewma 13.552/105.503 ms
\end{lstlisting}
Let us now interpret the results of ping command:
As it can be seen, the transmission time does not change dramatically with the size of packets, suggesting that the bottleneck is not the time to process a packet of a given size but maybe the necessary time for the OS to start the thread for the LKL network interface.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Round Trip Time} is defined as the length of time it takes for a packet to be sent plus the length of time it takes for an acknowledgement of that packet to be received.
As it can be seen from ping output 

\textbf{rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 6.929/112.462/196.023/34.576 ms}
for a 56B packet length (the default packet size for ping) and 

\textbf{rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 35.973/114.888/200.100/34.401 ms}

for a 1400B packet size. There is no significant difference for the average,maximum RTT time or the standard deviation\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation}}, the only difference being in the minimum RTT for a packet.  
\item \textbf{Inter-Packet Gap} is the idle time between two subsequent packet transmissions which gives the medium enough time to stabilize and network devices time to process the packet;

\item \textbf{Exponential Weighted Moving Average}\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average_(finance)#Exponential_moving_average}} 
During operations, the effective idle time is measured using an exponential weighted moving average (EWMA), which considers 
recent packets to be exponentially more important than past ones. 

\item \textbf{Throughput} is defined as the average rate of successful message delivery over a 
communication channel. Its measurement unit is either bps (bits per second) or packets per second.
We have decided to compute the \textbf{throughput} based on the RTT as 2*1000/RTT which issues a throughput 
value of \approx 150 packets per second. It was noticed that during ping the number of context switches 
was higher by 2000-3000 context switches denoting that the low rate of packets per second is due to 
latency induced by the high number of context swithes. 
\end{itemize}
\section{Scalability}
\label{sec:scalability}

In order to test how scalable a router is, we have tested the memory it requires for different load levels that have been obtained 
by varying the number of routes and the number of NAT and Firewall rules.
\figref{img:routes-used-mem} presents the results obtained by varying the number of routes.
\fig[scale=0.4]{src/img/routes-mem.png}{img:routes-used-mem}{Required Memory by Routes}
As it can be seen the memory needed varies almost linear with the number of rules, 1000 more rules requiring 0.2 or 0.3 MB more.

During these tests we have tested as well how the time to forward packets is influenced by the 
number of routes in the route table using the topology presented in \figref{img:routes-forward}, where routes were added on Router0, 
a server was connected to Hub2 and a client was connected to Hub0. The time for receiving the server 
response was only slightly different with the increase of routes number, proving that the route was already in cache.
\fig[scale=0.4]{src/img/routes-forward.png}{img:routes-forward}{Topology for testing Necessary Time to Search Routing Table}

When testing how the increase of NAT and Firewall rules influences memory use, the results were 
almost similar for NAT and Firewall rules since they both are represented as ipt_entry structures.\figref{img:nat-used-mem} 
illustrates these results.
\fig[scale=0.4]{src/img/nat-firewall-mem.png}{img:nat-used-mem}{Required Memory by NAT and Firewall Rules}

I have tested as well CPU load due to a running router by connecting a bridge to the interface eth0 of 
the Router0 from the topology presented in \figref{img:routes-forward} and pinging the router interface using the following command
\lstset{language=TeX,caption=Commands for configuring the bridge,label=test-bridge-config}
\begin{lstlisting}
sudo ping 10.10.10.10 -f
\end{lstlisting}
and the highest load was 4\%.

Below is a table showing the memory requirements due to Hub and Router devices for different loads:
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[htb]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
    \hline
      Device Name & State & Memory Use \\ \hline
      Hub & Running & \approx 80kB \\ \hline
      Router & Just started & 1.7 MB\\ \hline
      Router & 1000 routes more & 0.2-0.3 MB more\\ \hline
      Router & 100 NAT or Firewall rules more & 0.2-0.3 MB more\\	
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

\section{Complex Topologies}
\label{sec:complex-top}
After doing tests on simple topologies the logical next step was to test the behaviour of \project devices when used for more complex topologies. 

The scenario for this simulation was a basic one: we wanted to be able to access a web page 
(lklnet.org -a nonexistent page that we built) using an existing browser(such as Chrome, Mozilla,etc) 
and be able at the same time to sniff the network traffic in order to see packets exchanged to fulfil the request for the page.

In order to achieve these topology requirements we needed to connect some external application to 
the \project devices: the web browser used on the localhost, a dns server for resolving the request for 
the web page and a web server on which the webpage resides. Both of the servers are virtual machines.
All the external applications were connected in the topology using the bridge.  
The topology we built is shown in \figref{img:web}.
\fig[scale=0.4]{src/img/web.png}{img:web}{Complex Topology Simulation}
The systems and their associated IPv4 addresses are listed in \tableref{table:complex-ip}
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[htb]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
	\hline
	System & IP \\ \hline
	Web Browser & 192.168.100.123/24 \\ \hline
	DNS Server & 192.168.100.200/24 \\ \hline
	Web Server & 192.168.200.123/24 \\	 
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Complex topology: IP addresses}
  \label{table:complex-ip}
  \end{table}
\end{center}
The router configuration is presented in \tableref{table:complex-router}
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[htb]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
	\hline
	Interface & IP \\ \hline
	eth0 & 192.168.100.1/24 \\ \hline
	eth1 & 192.168.200.1/24 \\	 
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Complex topology: Router configuration}
  \label{table:complex-router}
  \end{table}
\end{center}
The switch configuration is shown in \tableref{table:complex-switch}
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[htb]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
	Interface & MAC\\ \hline
	eth0 & 00:bb:cc:00:01:01\\ \hline
	eth1 & 00:bb:cc:00:02:02\\ \hline
	eth2 & 00:bb:cc:00:01:02\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Complex topology: Switch configuration}
  \label{table:complex-switch}
  \end{table}
\end{center}
Besides the already connected bridges one additional one was connected between the switch and router to allow for traffic sniffing.

After issuing the request for the web page, several actions are taken in order to fulfill the request and in the end the web page is shown in the browser.
The actions needed to retrieve the requested web page are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Make an ARP request for the DNS server address: switches broadcast the arp request packet and eventually an ARP Response is received from the DNS server
	\item The web browser issues a  DNS request for lklnet.org
	\item A DNS response is received from the DNS server specifying the IPv4 address of the webserver.
	\item Initiate TCP connection to the web server
	\item The web browser initiates a web page request
	\item The web page response is received from the web server
	\item TCP hangup
\end{itemize}
The packets exchanged during these actions can be seen using tcpdump tool connected to one or more of the bridges.
Following is a dump of packets obtained from the bridge connected between the web browser and the switch:
\lstset{language=TeX,caption=,label=tcpdump}
\begin{lstlisting}
tcpdump -ne -i tap0 "arp"
listening on tap0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 96 bytes
13:02:05.904217 7e:63:a6:ce:d8:dd > aa:bb:cc:00:01:02, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 42: Request who-has 192.168.100.1 tell 192.168.100.123, length 28
13:02:05.905068 aa:bb:cc:00:01:02 > 7e:63:a6:ce:d8:dd, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 42: Reply 192.168.100.1 is-at aa:bb:cc:00:01:02, length 28
\end{lstlisting}
One can see that the above dump is from an ARP request for the MAC address of the gateway which is the router.
